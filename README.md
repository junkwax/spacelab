# SpaceLab - Dark Matter and Black Holes in Higher Dimensions

This repository explores a theoretical framework to understand the relationship between **dark matter**, **black holes**, and **higher-dimensional spacetime**. By incorporating:

- **Axion-like dark matter**.
- **Dynamical dark energy** (quintessence).
- **Higher-dimensional spacetime** (Kaluza-Klein theory).
- **Numerical simulations** of black hole dynamics and dark matter distributions.

We aim to develop a testable model that can be compared with observational data, offering insights into the mysteries of dark matter and gravitational waves. This project is designed to be a bridge between speculative theoretical physics and empirical science.

## Project Overview

This project combines the following key components:

- **General Relativity**: Describes gravity through the curvature of spacetime.
- **Kaluza-Klein Theory**: Extends the theory to include extra dimensions.
- **Scalar Field Dark Matter**: Models dark matter as an axion-like particle.
- **Dynamical Dark Energy**: Uses a quintessence field to explain cosmic acceleration.

Our goal is to produce a **testable theoretical framework** that matches observational data (e.g., galactic rotation curves, gravitational waves, etc.). The project aims to push the boundaries of dark matter and higher-dimensional physics, providing insight into both the microscopic and macroscopic universe.

## Key Features

### Theoretical Framework
- **Higher-Dimensional Metric**: Utilizes a 5D spacetime metric with an extra compactified dimension.
- **Dark Matter Lagrangian**: Describes axion-like dark matter with couplings to dilaton and graviphoton fields.
- **Dynamical Dark Energy**: Models dark energy using a quintessence field \( V(\phi_{\text{DE}}) \).
- **Stress-Energy Tensor**: Includes bulk terms derived from extra dimensions.

### Numerical Implementation
- **Partial Differential Equation Solvers**: Solve for black hole dynamics and dark matter distributions.
- **Global Fits**: Perform parameter estimation using MCMC techniques.
- **Parallelization**: Optimized for use on high-performance computing (HPC) systems.

### Observational Tests
- **Galactic Rotation Curves**: Compare model predictions with observational data (e.g., SPARC dataset).
- **Gravitational Wave Signals**: Compare simulated black hole merger waveforms with LIGO/Virgo data.
- **Gamma-Ray Flux**: Compute and compare dark matter annihilation signals with Fermi-LAT data.

## Getting Started

This section will guide you through the process of getting the project up and running on your machine.

### Example Outputs
Once the simulations are run, you should expect to receive:

- **Simulated Black Hole Dynamics**: Time evolution of black holes in higher-dimensional spacetime.
- **Dark Matter Distribution**: Visualization of the dark matter density in galactic systems.
- **Parameter Estimations**: Results of global fits to observational data, including confidence intervals on cosmological parameters.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ or C++17
- Required libraries: **NumPy**, **SciPy**, **emcee**, **PETSc**, **MPI**, **CosmoMC**, **Cobaya**

If you're new to this project, we provide example data files (e.g., `data/observational_data.h5`) to help you get started without needing to gather external datasets.
