# SpaceLab: Exploring Dark Matter and Black Holes in Higher Dimensions

Welcome to **SpaceLab**, a project that explores the interplay between **dark matter**, **black holes**, and **higher-dimensional spacetime**. This repository contains the theoretical framework, numerical implementation, and observational tests for a model that bridges speculative theoretical physics with empirical science.

## Project Overview

SpaceLab aims to develop a **testable theoretical framework** that incorporates:

- **Axion-like dark matter**.
- **Dynamical dark energy** (quintessence).
- **Higher-dimensional spacetime** (Kaluza-Klein theory).
- **Numerical simulations** of black hole dynamics and dark matter distributions.

The project combines theoretical models with observational data to provide insights into the nature of dark matter, black holes, and the structure of spacetime.

## Key Features

### Theoretical Framework
- **Higher-Dimensional Metric**: Incorporates a 5D spacetime metric with a compactified extra dimension.
- **Dark Matter Lagrangian**: Describes axion-like dark matter with couplings to the dilaton and graviphoton.
- **Dynamical Dark Energy**: Uses a quintessence field with a potential \( V(\phi_{\text{DE}}) \) 
- **Stress-Energy Tensor**: Includes bulk terms from higher dimensions.

### Numerical Implementation
- **PDE Solvers**: Solves coupled partial differential equations for black hole dynamics and dark matter distributions.
- **Global Fits**: Uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to fit model parameters to observational data.
- **Parallelization**: Optimized for high-performance computing (HPC) environments.

### Observational Tests
- **Galactic Rotation Curves**: Compares predicted rotation velocities with SPARC data.
- **Gravitational Waves**: Simulates black hole mergers and compares waveforms with LIGO/Virgo data.
- **Gamma-Ray Flux**: Computes dark matter annihilation signals and compares with Fermi-LAT data.
